import requests

def test_health_check():

    assert(r.status_code == 404)

# 1. Add two more tests here of your choice. I will explain the API.
#    Make sure to verify the necessary info, e.g., status code, response data.
# 2. Add "pytest" as integration testing script as part of Github Actions CI workflow (you've done this before!)
